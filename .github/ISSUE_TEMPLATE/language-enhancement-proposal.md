## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what problem this proposal is addressing.

## Rationale

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is that some common task is currently hard to express in Yarn Spinner, show how one can currently get a similar effect, and describe its drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that can't be emulated in the current language, explain why this new functionality would help writers or programmers work with Yarn code.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Yarn grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be sufficient for someone who is not one of the proposal authors to be able to reasonably implement the feature.

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and why you chose this approach instead.

## Acknowledgments

If significant changes or improvements suggested by members of the community were incorporated into the proposal as it developed, take a moment here to thank them for their contributions. Designing the Yarn language is a collaborative process, and everyone's input should receive recognition!

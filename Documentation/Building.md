# Building Yarn Spinner

> ***Important:*** This document only matters to you if you want to build Yarn Spinner from source. In almost all cases, you'll be totally fine with [downloading a build](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/releases), and using that in your project.

To build Yarn Spinner, you'll need MonoDevelop. You can [download MonoDevelop for your OS from the MonoDevelop site](http://www.monodevelop.com/download/).

Once it's downloaded, follow these steps:

* Open **YarnSpinner.sln**.
* Open the **Build menu**, and choose **Build All**.
* Open the **Unity/Assets/Yarn Spinner** folder. You'll find a copy of **YarnSpinner.dll** there. You can now copy that DLL file wherever you need it.

# Yarn Spinner Documentation

## Yarn Documentation

Documentation for Yarn Spinner is under active development. Please submit any suggestions you may have.

Yarn Spinner API documentation is generated automatically by the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) system.

The documentation is currently automatically generated every time a commit is made to the Master branch on GitHub. The documentation is availabe on our GitHub Page in [HTML](http://thesecretlab.github.io/YarnSpinner/html/) and in our Github Repository in [Latex](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/gh-pages/latex), PDF, [RTF](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/gh-pages/rtf), and [XML](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/gh-pages/xml) formats.

If you are working on the [Development branch](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/development), the [build.sh](../build.sh) script is capable of generating documents for you locally by utilising the -d switch.

## Building Yarn Spinner
Yarn Spinner is automatically built by [Travis Continual Integration](https://travis-ci.org/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner) system. For information on how to build it yourself, please refer to the [Building](YarnSpinner-Programming/Building.md) document.

## Creating Yarn Dialogue for Yarn Spinner
For information on how to write dialogue for Yarn Spinner, refer to the [Usage](YarnSpinner-Dialogue/Advanced-Dialogue-Usage.md) document. We are currently expanding this documentation for writers, and we have a document on [how to create the dialogue for the Simple Example](YarnSpinner-Dialogue/Simple-Dialogue-Example.md) and are currently working on covering [the more complex example](YarnSpinner-Dialogue/Complex-Dialogue-Example.md)

## Using Unity
At this point in time, only examples for the [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) game engine are available. We hope to include a more generic example in the future. Please refer to the [Yarn Spinner Unity](YarnSpinner-Unity/) documents for more information.

# Yarn Spinner Documentation

## Yarn Documentation

Documentation for Yarn Spinner is under active development. Please submit any suggestions you may have.

Yarn Spinner API documentation is generated automatically by the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) system.

The documentation is currently automatically generated every time a commit is made to the Master branch on GitHub. The documentation is availabe on our GitHub Page in [HTML](http://thesecretlab.github.io/YarnSpinner/html/) and in our Github Repository in [Latex](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/gh-pages/latex), PDF, [RTF](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/gh-pages/rtf), and [XML](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/gh-pages/xml) formats.

If you are working on the [Development branch](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/tree/development), the [build.sh](../build.sh) script is capable of generating documents for you locally by utilising the -d switch.

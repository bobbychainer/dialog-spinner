# Notes/Roadmap

This is my notes document for planning/executing the YarnSpinner-Dialogue documentation overhaul.

**Goal: to do a cleanup pass on all YarnSpinner documentation, and overhaul the YarnSpinner-Dialogue documentation.**

## Phases:

#### 1. Triage

* Write planning document. (check!)
* Find where information is duplicated.
* **Identify user needs.**
* Document test cases and syntax used within.
* Check for inconsistencies or incorrect information.
* Establish list of blind spots in documentation (i.e. style guide).

#### 2. Cleanup & content creation

* Create style guide.
* Remove duplicate information.
* Rename files to fit a consistent naming schema/set up new file structure to better fit needs.
    * Check all existing documentation (Programming + Unity) for broken links to removed or renamed files.
* Edit/rework/rewrite existing documentation for conciseness, etc.
* **Write syntax reference documentation.** (priority/the reason I'm doing this whole thing)

#### 3. Final pass

* Check all links.
* Check that all content conforms to style guide.
* 

## Triage

#### Duplicate files to be removed:

* ~~Yarn-HowTo-Write-Dialogue-Simple-Example.md (old dupe of Simple-Dialogue-Example.md)~~
* ~~Yarn-HowTo-Write-Dialogue-Complex-Example.md (old dupe of Complex-Dialogue-Example.md)~~
* ~~Localization.md (old dupe of Dialogue-Localization.md)~~

Done.

#### Files to be touched:

Rework:
* Advanced-Dialogue-Usage.md

Rename:
* All of 'em

#### Issues/inconsistencies/pain points with existing documentation

1. ~~Multiple duplicate files exist to explain Yarn dialogue.~~ **Fixed.**
2. Naming schema is inconsistent and unclear (Simple-Dialogue-Example should be Dialogue-Simple or something).
3. Does not explicitly address use cases, let alone common edge cases.

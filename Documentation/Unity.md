## Tutorial

> ***Note:*** This tutorial assumes that you know a little bit about [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com). In particular, it is helpful that you know how to get around the Unity editor, how to work with game objects, and how to write scripts in C#. If you don't know these things, please refer to [Unity's documentation](http://unity3d.com/learn). It is also helpful if you know a little about the Yarn Editor.

## Yarn Spinner Quick Start

If you're already familiar with Unity and the Yarn Editor, we have a [Unity Quickstart](Unity-QuickStart.md) guide.

## Step by Step

If you've not done much more than install Unity and the Yarn Editor and confirmed that menu and dialogue functions of these applications appear operational, our [Step By Step](Unity-StepByStep.md) guide is intended to walk you through the creation of a very basic game using Yarn Spinner.

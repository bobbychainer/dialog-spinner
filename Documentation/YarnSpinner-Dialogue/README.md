# Writing Yarn Dialogue - README

## Introducing Yarn Dialogue

Yarn Dialogue is designed to be accessible to writers who have little or no programming knowledge. It makes no assumptions about how your game presents dialogue to the player, or about how the player chooses their responses. These tasks are left to the game production team, using programming and design tools such as Unity3D and C#.

### Simple Dialogue Tutorial
In [our simple dialogue tutorial](Simple-Dialogue-Example.md), we create a simple piece of Dialogue that demonstrates basic Yarn functionality. 

### Complex Dialogue Tutorial
In the [complex dialogue tutorial](Complex-Dialogue-Example.md), we create a slightly more complex piece of Dialogue. This example demonstrates more advanced Yarn functionality, such as commands, variables, and logic statements. 

### Localization
Our [localization](Dialogue-Localization.md) document describes how localization, or translating the text into other languages, takes place.
> ***Note:*** At the moment, it is a requirement that a programmer run a special tool across the Dialogue to produce the files to be translated.

### General Usage
We have a page of [general usage](Advanced-Dialogue-Usage.md), describing many further features of the Yarn Language. It also containins small Dialogue snippets as well as tips and suggestions you might find useful.

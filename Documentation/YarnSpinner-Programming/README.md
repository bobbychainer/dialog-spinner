## Introduction

This document lists the other document that comprise the Programming documentation for Yarn Spinner. Programming Yarn Spinner is intended to mean coding C# to achieve the goals set out in Yarn Dialogue to meet the proudction requirements of producing a game. The game can be produced using any engine, however for now we only document using Unity.

## Building
The [Building](Building.md) assists you in compiling the Yarn Spinner software. You may need to build Yarn Spinner yourself, particularly if you wish to test out certain code or use tools (such as [Localiisation](../YarnSpinner-Dialogue/Localization.md).

## Extending
The default Yarn Spinner code may not provide enough functionality for your game, so you will need to extend it by adding your own functions.  The [Extending](Extending.md) documentation provides an example on how to create custom C# code to integrate with [Yarn Dialogue](../YarnSpinner-Dialogue/)

### API Reference
The [API Reference](https://thesecretlab.github.io/YarnSpinner/html/) is available online for the current release. It's possible to use the build script to create your own. See the [Building](Building.md) documentation for information on how to do this.

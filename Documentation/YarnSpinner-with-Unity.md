## Tutorial

> ***Note:*** This tutorial assumes that you know a little bit about [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com). In particular, it is helpful that you know how to get around the Unity editor, how to work with game objects, and how to write scripts in C#. If you don't know these things, please refer to [Unity's documentation](http://unity3d.com/learn). It is also helpful if you know a little about the Yarn Editor.

## Yarn Spinner Quick Start

If you're already familiar with Unity and the Yarn Editor, we have a [Unity Quickstart](YarnSpinner-with-Unity-QuickStart.md) guide.

## Step by Step

If you've not done much more than install Unity and the Yarn Editor and confirmed that menu and dialogue functions of these applications appear operational, our [Step By Step](YarnSpinner-with-Unity-StepByStep.md) guide is intended to walk you through the creation of a very basic game using Yarn Spinner.

## Tips during Unity install

### Windows

Find the temp folder the installer has executed from and back it up before it completes installing.

### Mac

### Linux

Unity for Linux is not available in formal release and we are not actively pursuing this platform, however we are very enthusastic about this future prospect. We have confirmed that Yarnspinner works with the current 5.6 release of [Unity for Linux](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/), although this has only been tested with our example Unity code on Debian Stretch (amd64 architecture).

We encourge Linux users to test Yarnspinner using the [Monodevelop FlatPak](http://www.monodevelop.com/download/linux/). Although FlatPak is designed to be Linux agnostic, we are currently utilising Gnome3 on Debian Stretch for desktop development purposes. Your mileage may vary on other Linux combinations and flavours, we are eager to receive your feedback.

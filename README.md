# Yarn Spinner

**Yarn Spinner** is an interpreter for the <a href="http://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn">Yarn</a> language, written in C#.

Yarn is a language that's designed to make it *super easy* to create interactive dialogue for games. Yarn's very similar in style to <a href="http://twinery.org">Twine</a>, so if you already know that, you'll be right at home! If you don't, that's cool - Yarn's syntax is extremely minimal, and there's not much there to learn. Yarn's used in a number of cool games, including <a href="http://nightinthewoods.com">Night In The Woods</a>. 

Yarn Spinner is designed to be easy to add to Unity games, but it's also intended for use in other contexts as well.

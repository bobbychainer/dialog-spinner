// Basic test stuff from infinite_ammo

Testing some stuff...

<<if $something_not_one is 1>>
    First if statement went wrong.
<<else>>
    First if statement went right! :)
<<endif>>

<<if $something_not_one is 0>>
    Second if statement went right! :)
<<else>>
    Second if statement went wrong. :(
<<endif>>

Ready for some options?
-> This is an option. The next one should say: Yay it worked!
-> This option shouldn't show up <<if $available is 1>>
-> Yay it worked! Select this option for sub-options.
    -> This is nested option 1
        Oh yes, this me option 1.
    -> This is nested option 2
        Oh man, this me option 2.
Now you should see two branches.
[[Go to branch 1|Branch1]]
[[Go to branch 2|Branch2]]

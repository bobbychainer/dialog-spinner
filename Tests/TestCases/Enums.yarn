// Create a new enum, "Food". Variables of this type can store one of these
// three cases:
<<enum Food>>
    <<case Apple>>
    <<case Orange>>
    <<case Pear>>
<<endenum>>

// Declare a new variable, of this type.
<<declare $favouriteFood = Food.Apple as Food>>

// The 'as Food' can be left out, because the compiler will figure it out
<<declare $secondFavouriteFood = Food.Orange>>

// Enum variables can be compared to each other
<<if $favouriteFood == Food.Apple>>
    I like apples!
<<elseif $favouriteFood == Food.Orange>>
    It's an error if you see this!
<<else>>
    It's an error if you see this!
<<endif>>

// Enum variables can be modified, just like all other variables
<<set $favouriteFood to Food.Orange>>

// (Just checking that we're not just evaluating all comparisons as true
// lol)
<<if $favouriteFood == Food.Apple>>
    It's an error if you see this!
<<elseif $favouriteFood != Food.Orange>>
    It's an error if you see this!
<<else>>
    I like oranges now!
<<endif>>

# Yarn Spinner Language Server for Visual Studio Code

[Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) helps you build branching narrative and dialogue in games. It's easy for writers to use, and has powerful features for integrating your content straight into your game.

This extension adds syntax highlighting support for Yarn Spinner code, in addition to code completion, semantic highlighting, diagnostics, and more. 

This extension is still in development, so features may be incomplete, unstable, or slow. The 2.0 version of Yarn Spinner is still in beta, so this extension will periodically be updated to support the latest release (currently targeting [v2.0.0 Beta 5](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta5)).

This extension is developed independently of Secret Lab Pty Ltd and the Yarn Spinner team, so if you have any questions or issues, please direct them to the [Yarn Spinner Language Server repo](https://github.com/pappleby/YarnSpinnerLanguageServer).
